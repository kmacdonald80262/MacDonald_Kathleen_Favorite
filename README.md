# My Favorite Sports Teams<br><br>
# Football and Basketball

## Introduction
This one page webpage showcases my favorite basketball annd football teams and a little bit<br>
about each of the teams! 
<br>

**What I Did?**<br>
While showcasing my favorite teams I ended up<br>
editing the pictures and choosing specific bio<br>
information which I then pulled from a database <br>
and rendered it onto the page in practice for our final<br>
portfolio project(showing info with a lightbox).<br>
